Information about the I2C A to D board

We have two of the following boards

https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/p/17/ADC-Pi-V2---Raspberry-Pi-Analogue-to-Digital-converter

Based on the MCP3424 from Microchip Technologies Inc
http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/22088b.pdf

These quad A to D's have an on-Board Voltage Reference (VREF): 2.048V ± 0.05%

<b>Volts per bit</b>
The A to D boards have a potential divider:
                       _____ Input to A to D
                      |
Input = 10K __/\/\/\__|__ 6K8 __/\/\/\__to AGND

Therefore, 5V in divides down to (5 x 6.8)/16.8 =2.023, which is a very close match for VREF.
at 16 bits, one bit = 5/(256 x 256) = 76uV
at 12 bits, one bit = 5/ (16x256) = 1.2mV

<b>Measure Current at up to 1 AMP</b>
Assume 1% voltage drop acceptable on Sense resistor
At 5V, this is a potential error of 50mV
At 1 Amp this is a drop of 50mV => Giving a Sense resistor value of R= 0.050/1
Power lost as heat = I^2R = 50mW
NOTE: 0.1R resistors much more common than 0.05 ohm resistors, so use two 0.1mOhm in parrallel.

JFET low input offset voltage 1mV
We want 50mV to give 5V out, amplification of 100
Offset voltage 1mV will amplify to 0.1V at amplification of 100 or 2%

<b>Power Supplies</b>

power supply of +/-6V's, 5V for Pi or possibly +/-5V using this Farnell part 2079668


Use two dual devices, to provide quad Current ,measurement and quad Voltage measurement on an 8 channel A to D board.
